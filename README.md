# bill-Splitter
This application is made for splitting the bills. Some key functionality offered is:
1. Ability to add new users
2. Create a new expense. Each expense has the following fields:
    2.1 User who incurred the bill
    2.2 Users who will share the bill
    2.3 Ratio in which the bill is to be shared
    2.4 Amount of the bill
    2.5 Tag associated with the bill
3. Simplify the expenses for a user - this would net all the transactions shared between a user and all the other users.
4. Simplify the expenses for all users. Same as #3, but for all users.
5. Show the expenditure by tag - this can be used to track expenses based on category of bill/purchase.
6. Show the net owes/owed/balance amount for a user.
7. Display the balance between any to users and give an option to settle the balance.

Features to be added in the future:
1. Directed settling of bills: For example if A owes B and B owes C and so on, the system would settle the bill so A has to pay the calculated amount to the last vertex only.
2. Link users with contacts
3. Introduce a parameter for date so that expenses can be tracked on regular basis based on tag
4. Introduce support for multiple currencies which are to be converted in real time.
5. Settlement of bills - !!ADDED!!
